# NY/NJ-Style Chicken Penne Vodka (Jar + Heavy Cream, Amateur-Proof)

This is the “red-sauce-joint” method: **sear cutlet-style chicken**, build a quick aromatic base, **finish pasta in the sauce**, and emulsify with **butter + Parm** for that glossy, clingy vibe.

---

## What you’re using
- **24 oz Carbone Spicy Vodka sauce**
- **Heavy cream** (you have it)
- **Pasta:** 1 × 12 oz bag (save the second bag unless you have a 2nd jar)
- **Chicken breast**
- **Garlic + shallot**
- **Parm + pecorino**
- **Enameled cast iron dutch oven** (great for sauce)
- **Cast iron skillet** (great for searing)
- **Stock pot** (for pasta)

---

## Ingredients (for 1 × 12 oz pasta bag)
### Chicken
- 1–1.25 lb chicken breast (about 2 breasts)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 to 1½ tsp kosher salt (divided; you’ll salt pasta water too)
- Black pepper

### Sauce
- 2 Tbsp butter (for the sauce base)
- 1 shallot, minced (knife-mince is best)
- 2–3 cloves garlic, **microplaned** (fine rasp is perfect)
- 24 oz Carbone Spicy Vodka sauce
- Heavy cream: **½ cup to 1 cup** (start with ½ cup)
- 1 Tbsp butter (finishing)

### Cheese
- ¾ cup Parmigiano-Reggiano, finely grated
- 2 Tbsp pecorino, finely grated (optional accent)

---

## Pasta water (exact setup + timing)
- Stock pot size: ideally 6–8 qt
- Water: **4 quarts / 16 cups**
- Salt: **2 Tbsp kosher salt** (or 1 Tbsp table salt)

**When to start heating the water:**  
Start it **right after you prep the shallot/garlic and grate cheese**, before you sear the chicken. Big pots take a while to boil, and you want it rolling by the time the sauce is ready.

---

## Quick timeline (so you’re not juggling)
1. Grate cheese + prep aromatics (5–8 min)
2. Start pasta water (immediately after prep)
3. Sear chicken (10–12 min)
4. Build sauce in dutch oven (8–10 min)
5. Cook pasta (pull 2 min early)
6. Finish pasta in sauce + cheese + butter (3–5 min)
7. Add chicken and serve

---

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1) Mise en place (5–8 minutes)
1. **Grate cheese** now (don’t wait):
   - ¾ cup parm + 2 Tbsp pecorino (keep together or separate)
2. **Shallot:** knife-mince 1 shallot (small pieces).
3. **Garlic:** microplane 2–3 cloves into a small bowl.
4. **Chicken:** pat dry. If thick, **butterfly/slice horizontally** into thinner cutlets (~½" thick).
5. Season chicken with:
   - Salt + pepper (lightly; you can adjust at the end)

> If you *must* microplane the shallot with a fine rasp: it becomes paste. Cook it a little longer (3–4 min) to drive off moisture before adding garlic.

---

### 2) Start pasta water (now)
- Put **4 quarts / 16 cups** water + salt in the stock pot.
- Lid on, **high heat**.

---

### 3) Sear chicken in cast iron skillet (10–12 minutes)
1. Heat skillet over **medium-high** for ~2 minutes.
2. Add **2 Tbsp olive oil**.
3. Add chicken cutlets (don’t overcrowd; do batches if needed).
4. Sear:
   - **4–5 min** first side (don’t move it)
   - Flip, **3–5 min** second side until cooked through
5. Remove chicken to a cutting board to rest.

---

### 4) Build sauce in the enameled dutch oven (8–10 minutes)
1. Put dutch oven on **medium** heat.
2. Add **2 Tbsp butter**.
3. Add minced shallot + pinch of salt.
   - Cook **2 minutes**, stirring, until softened (not browned).
4. Add microplaned garlic.
   - Cook **30 seconds**, stirring constantly (garlic paste burns fast).
5. Add **24 oz jar sauce**.
6. Add **½ cup heavy cream** and stir.
7. Bring to a **gentle simmer** (small bubbles), cook **3–5 minutes**.

**Taste + adjust:**
- If it’s too spicy/intense → add **¼ cup more cream**, taste again.
- You can go up to **1 cup total cream**, but keep it **pink + tomato-forward**, not pale.

Turn heat to **low** to keep warm while pasta cooks.

---

### 5) Cook pasta (pull it early)
When the pasta water is at a rolling boil:
1. Add **12 oz pasta**.
2. Cook **2 minutes less** than the package “al dente” time.
3. **Reserve 1–1½ cups pasta water** (important).
4. Drain pasta.

---

### 6) Finish pasta IN the sauce (the “authentic” step)
1. Add drained pasta directly into the dutch oven sauce.
2. Turn heat to **medium-low**.
3. Stir/toss **1–2 minutes**.
4. Add pasta water in splashes:
   - Start with **¼ cup**
   - Stir hard until sauce turns **silky and glossy**
   - Add more splashes only if needed (don’t flood it)

You’re aiming for sauce that **clings** and looks restaurant-glossy.

---

### 7) Turn heat OFF → emulsify with butter + cheese (no clumps)
1. Turn heat **OFF**.
2. Add **1 Tbsp butter**, stir until melted.
3. Add **¾ cup parm** + **2 Tbsp pecorino**.
4. Stir vigorously until creamy.

If it tightens up: add **1–3 Tbsp** pasta water and stir again.

---

### 8) Slice chicken + combine
1. Slice chicken into strips (classic NY/NJ look).
2. Fold into pasta (or top each bowl).
3. Finish with extra parm + black pepper.

---

## Notes + common fixes
- **Sauce too thick:** add pasta water 1 Tbsp at a time and stir.
- **Sauce too spicy:** add a bit more cream OR an extra small knob of butter.
- **Too salty:** skip pecorino next time and rely on parm only; also be careful salting the sauce (the jar can be salty).

---

## About your 2nd bag of pasta
With **one 24 oz jar**, the best result is **one 12 oz bag**.
If you cook **both bags (24 oz pasta)**, you’ll want **a second 24 oz jar** (or the dish will be under-sauced).
