# Healthy Organic Mexican Tortilla Soup (Pregnancy-Safe)

A lighter, cozy take on the news clipping: **baked tortilla strips**, **low-sodium broth**, and pregnancy-safe best practices.

**Serves:** 6  
**Time:** ~45 minutes

---

## Pregnancy-safe highlights
- Chicken cooked to **165°F** (no pink).
- Use **pasteurized** dairy only (yogurt/sour cream/cheese).
- Lower-sodium approach (helps with swelling/BP).

## Ingredients (organic when possible)

### Soup

- **3 cloves garlic, minced** (or microplaned)

### Optional toppings (pregnancy-friendly)

## Instructions

### 1) Bake tortilla strips (start first)
1. Heat oven to **400°F (205°C)**.
2. Stack tortillas and slice into thin strips.
3. Toss strips with **1 Tbsp oil** + pinch of salt (and optional spices).
4. Spread on a sheet pan in a single layer.
5. Bake **8–12 minutes**, tossing once halfway, until crisp and golden.

*Air fryer option:* 375°F for 5–8 minutes, shake once.

### 2) Cook the chicken
1. In a large pot/Dutch oven, heat **1 Tbsp oil** over **medium-high**.
2. Cut chicken into bite-size cubes. Season with salt + pepper.
3. Sauté **4–6 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until mostly cooked and lightly browned.

> Safety: chicken must reach **165°F** in the thickest piece.

---

### 3) Sauté onions + garlic, then simmer potatoes
1. Add chopped onion to the pot with the chicken.
2. Cook **4–5 minutes** until softened.
3. Add **minced garlic** and cook **30–60 seconds** until fragrant (don’t brown it).
4. Add diced potatoes + broth.
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer **10–12 minutes**, until potatoes are tender.

---

### 4) Finish the soup
1. Add corn + green chiles + cumin + oregano (+ smoked paprika if using).
2. Simmer **5–8 minutes**.
3. Stir in cilantro (or parsley).
4. Taste and adjust salt/pepper.
5. Finish with lime juice (start with 1/2 lime, add more to taste).

---

### 5) Serve
- Put a handful of tortilla strips in each bowl.
- Ladle soup over top.
- Add toppings (avocado + yogurt + cabbage is a great combo).
- Squeeze extra lime.

---

## Optional “even healthier” tweaks
- Add 1 diced zucchini in the last 8 minutes.
- Add 1 can drained black beans with the corn for more fiber/iron.
- Swap half the potatoes for cauliflower florets.
- For lower sodium: use **4 cups broth + 2 cups water** and salt at the end.

## Storage
- Fridge: 3–4 days
- Freeze: up to 3 months (freeze soup **without** tortilla strips)
- Reheat soup until steaming hot; keep strips separate so they stay crisp.
